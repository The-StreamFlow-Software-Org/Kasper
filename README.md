# Kasper
Kasper is a scalable, persistent, in-memory nested key-value database designed for asynchronous operations and blazingly fast access. Built with Java.

## Why Kasper?

- Kasper stays in the memory, making it faster than traditional databases.
- Kasper allows for nested data structures not present in other in-memory databases like Redis.
- Kasper has a robust, easy-to-use API with Kasper Drivers.
- Kasper is persistent and allows for data to persist even if shut down.


## Why Not Kasper?

- Kasper is expensive to maintain as a primary database as it runs in the memory.
- Kasper has limited caching support as of the moment.
- Databases such as Redis may be faster for simpler data models.

## The Kasper Implementation Roadmap:

## For KasperBeans (Kasper Java Driver / API):
- Build client-side logic for retrieving nested date.
- BUild client-side logic for filter operations for server-side computing.

## For the Kasper Server
- Build authentication features
- Build the Kasper Toolkit with Swing
- Create a diagram for handling server operations
- Implement a ROM storage system for persistence.
- Implement multiple queries feature.
